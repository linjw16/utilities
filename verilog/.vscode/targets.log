define find_libpython_errmsg


find_libpython was not able to find a libpython in the current Python environment. Ensure
the Python development packages are installed. If they are installed and find_libpython
is not finding the path to libpython, file an upstream bug in find_libpython; then
manually override the LIBPYTHON_LOC make variable with the absolute path to libpython.so
(or python.dll on Windows).
